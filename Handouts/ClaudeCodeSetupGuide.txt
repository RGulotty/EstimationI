How to Start Using Claude on the Terminal (CLI)
(Step-by-Step Guide)

1. Create an empty folder on your computer.
   You can use Finder for this.
   In your Documents folder, create a folder called "Claude" and a folder
   inside it called "test."

2. Open "Terminal."
   You can use Spotlight (Cmd + Space) to search for it. You might want to
   pin it to your Dock from now on (right-click > Options > Keep in Dock).

3. Go to your new folder.
   Type "cd " in the terminal (with a space after it) and drag the folder
   you just made into the terminal window. Press Enter.

4. Create an account.
   Go to https://claude.ai/referral/jbmKch_jlA and create an account if
   you haven't already. You will need a subscription plan to use Claude Code.

5. Install Claude Code.
   Go to the terminal and type (or copy-paste):

      curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

   Press Enter. This downloads and installs Claude Code.
   (For Windows, see: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup)

6. Set up your path (so your system knows where Claude is).
   After the installation finishes, type this into your terminal:

      echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

   Press Enter. Then close your terminal and open a new one. This is a
   one-time step -- you won't need to do it again.

   After reopening the terminal, navigate back to your folder (repeat Step 3).

7. Start Claude.
   In the terminal, type:

      claude

   and press Enter. Since this is a fresh install, Claude will ask you to
   accept the terms of service and choose a permission mode. The permission
   mode controls how much Claude can do without asking you first. If you're
   just getting started, the default settings are fine.

8. Log in.
   Claude will open a browser tab for you to log in with your account.
   If the browser doesn't open automatically, Claude will give you a link
   to copy-paste into your browser. This connects the installation to your
   account.

9. Start creating!
   You can now ask Claude to write code, analyze data, create files, and
   more -- all inside the folder you made in Step 1.

   Claude can download, create, and execute files in your folder, so it
   will ask you for permission before running commands (e.g., "Can I run
   this Python script?"). Stay near your machine so it doesn't get stuck
   waiting for your approval.

   Example prompts to try:
   - "Write a Python script that prints Hello World"
   - "Create an R script that generates a scatterplot of 100 random points"
   - "Explain what the ls command does"

10. Saving and resuming sessions.
    If you want to quit, type:

       /exit

    or press Ctrl+C a few times.

    To pick up where you left off, open Terminal, navigate back to your
    folder (Step 3), and type:

       claude --continue

    This resumes your most recent conversation in that folder.

    To see a list of past conversations and choose one:

       claude --resume

11. Useful commands inside Claude.
    While Claude is running, you can type these slash commands:

       /help        See all available commands
       /compact     Summarize the conversation to free up context space
       /clear       Clear the conversation and start fresh
       /exit        Quit Claude and return to the terminal
