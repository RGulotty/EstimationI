title: "Estimation I: Computational Companion"
subtitle: "PLSC 30700 — University of Chicago"
---

This site is a computational companion to the lecture slides for **Estimation I** (PLSC 30700), taught by Robert Gulotty at the University of Chicago.

Each chapter mirrors a lecture topic and demonstrates the key ideas in R. The goal is not to replace the slides or the textbook, but to give you a parallel way to build intuition: by computing, simulating, and visualizing the concepts.

## How to use this site

- **Read alongside the lectures.** Each chapter covers the same material as the corresponding lecture, but tells the story through code.
- **Run the code yourself.** Copy-paste into R or RStudio. Modify the examples. Break things.
- **Focus on understanding, not memorization.** The code is a tool for building intuition about what the math is doing.

## Prerequisites

You will need R installed. The following packages are used throughout:

```r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "MASS", "car", "carData", "sensemakr",
                   "sandwich", "lmtest", "estimatr", "haven", "plm", "boot",
                   "AER", "gmm", "panelView", "fixest", "did", "fect"))
```
